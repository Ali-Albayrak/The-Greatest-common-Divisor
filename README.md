This is a simple Python program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of a list of positive integers. 
It provides three functions: `gcd_two_numbers`, `gcd_numbers`, and `get_numbers`.

## Features

- Calculates the GCD of two positive integers using the Euclidean Algorithm.
- Calculates the GCD of a list of positive integers by utilizing the `gcd_two_numbers` function.
- Reads a list of positive integers from the user and validates the input.
